## Deployment

Clone this repository can be done wit Git and terminal through VSCode.
The other fields that need to be cloned is templates, static, Requirement txt, and .env to hold our API code.

One main problem I has with this code is calling the API links for specific catergories in movie data Base.
In different aspecct of of getting the API link, the theres information to get you spefic information like reviews and have to pull other API and interlink them so we can the specfic category we want and list in out web app. 

Another is getting randomzinzing the movies with falsk and import random which be came really simply as I dig in more on the web app. 
I fixed just by creating list input and randomzinzing with with movies I choose for web appp so when it refresh, a different movie will so.
